            <p>
                Hi, my name is Kayden Roberts I am a Senior Student at Cape Central High School in Cape Girardeau
                Missouri. I created this website for my final project in my Web Development class. I have always had a passion for fashion and coding/programming. So I thought a sample resell clothing website would be the perfect final project. This website functions just like a real website would except you can't actually buy the clothes on here. All pictures for the website (besides for the pictures of myself) are made with the power of Ai and are based on real clothing brands that I like. Outside of this project in particular, I am working on my web design and development skills. I am also learning how to use different programming languages such as JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, etc. I hope you enjoy my website and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact me.
